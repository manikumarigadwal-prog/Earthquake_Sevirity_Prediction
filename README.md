# Earthquake_Sevirity_Prediction
Supervised Machine Learning is used to build two predictive models: one for earthquake severity (multi-class classification) and one for tsunami hazard (binary classification).
Data preprocessing pipelines handle missing values, scale numeric features, and encode categorical variables automatically.
Random Forest Classifier is used for severity prediction due to its robustness and ability to handle complex patterns.
Logistic Regression is used for tsunami prediction as a simple and effective binary classifier.Models are evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports, and then saved for real-time predictions.
